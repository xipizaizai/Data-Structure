1. Meeting rooms II:O(nlogn)
    idea is to find their intervals and merge them, then find out the size of the priorityqueue = the # of rooms needed
    
2. Merge Intervals:O(nlogn)
    the same idea with meeting rooms II, basic is merge intervals, use min heap, sort all intervals using start index, check if end index can be merged
