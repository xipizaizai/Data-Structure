1. Valid Tic-Tac-Toe State: O(n)
      the idea is to check whether it is a valid state: 
        three rules applied:
          1. # of 'X' is always one more than # of 'O'
          2. when rol or col or diagonal or antidiagonal reaches three, then one of palyer has win
          3. if X is win, then turn==1 || O wins, then turn = 0

2.  Valid Square:
      idea is to use the property of a square, diagonal length = sqrt(2)*side.
