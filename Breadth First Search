1. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal:
          classic topic of BFS: use a queue to maintain a structure. 
          for each level, get a size of that level and poll node out, add in level list
          add each node's left and node's right into the queue for later poll out
          
2. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree:
          use BFS to search level order, when you meet a node has no left and right child, return the level
          or add their child to the queue and increment the level

3. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal II:
          level order traversal and reverse it
