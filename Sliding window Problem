1.  Longest Repeating Character Replacement:O(N)
    Idea is that using sliding window to get the maximum length when satisfy all the conditions.
    The problem says that we can make at most k changes to the string (any character can be replaced with any other character). 
    So, let's say there were no constraints like the k. Given a string convert it to a string with all same characters with minimal changes. 
    The answer to this is:length of the entire string - number of times of the maximum occurring character in the string
    Given this, we can apply the at most k changes constraint and maintain a sliding window such that:
        (length of substring - number of times of the maximum occurring character in the substring) <= k
