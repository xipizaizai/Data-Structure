1. Encode and Decode TinyURL:
    Using hashcode method to calculate the code for the string and store it in the map as key
    Encode just return the hashcode
    Decode need use the hashcode to find the value of this code
    
2. Peeking Iterator：
    Using Iterator class interface methods: next() and hasNext()
    peek(): return the next number without moving the iterator
    next(): return the next number with moving the iterator to the next number
    hasNext(): return whether next number is null or not null
    
    Follow up:
    To accomodate all the generic type, maybe there will have null in the input, then you need to have a boolean type to record whether there is no element in the rest
    
3. Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)：
    Idea is to use a hashmap and a arrayList to do all the operations, hashmap key is the interger, and the value is its index,then everytime when remove the element, swap this index with the last one in the arraylist, update the element in map also.
