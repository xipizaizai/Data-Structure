一. Find number missing:
  
    1. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array: O(n),O(1)space
      because the array is from 1~size of num, then i can use this, we iterate through the input array and mark elements as negative using nums[nums[i] -1] = -nums[nums[i]-1]. In this way all the numbers that we have seen will be marked as negative. In the second iteration, if a value is not marked as negative, it implies we have never seen that index before, so just add it to the return list.
      
二. Sort:
    1. wiggle sort:O(n)
      Idea is that using swap, 
                  If i is odd, then nums[i] >= nums[i - 1];
                  If i is even, then nums[i] <= nums[i - 1].
      use swap when not meeting the two conditions
    2. 
三. In-place problem:
    1. Game of Life:O(MN)
      Idea is that you need to calculate the circling 8 element to see how many lives, but inplace update will change it, then think about when the live node changed, make it a number when later you can recognize that a live node before. then use 1,2,3 which 1,3 represents live node and 2 represent dead node. because later can mod by 2. then 2 represent the node before is live node but changed to dead node, 3 represent the node before is dead node but changed to live node.
    
    2. Flipping an Image:O(n^2)
      Idea is that you can do it inplace, first swap each row in the matrix, then invert it at the last move.
    
    3. RLE Iterator:O(n) for next
      Idea is that we search in place, no need extra memory space, we have two pointers: one for keep track the index, another is to keep track of the number of the needed element left. if the number left+it want >all it get, then move on to the next available elements.
     
    4. Circular Array Loop:O(n)time+O(1)space
      Idea is that we start from each index and find whether there will lead to a cycle loop for this index, we change the already been index to 0. when occur that 0 in the next loop then check whether the current index == i then means we go back to where we begin.
      Attention we need a 
                if (nums[cur] == 0) continue; because there is no 0 exists at the begining, then when occur a zero, it must be the loop before.Or it will always be true
