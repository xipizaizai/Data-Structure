    1. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array: O(n),O(1)space
      because the array is from 1~size of num, then i can use this, we iterate through the input array and mark elements as negative using nums[nums[i] -1] = -nums[nums[i]-1]. In this way all the numbers that we have seen will be marked as negative. In the second iteration, if a value is not marked as negative, it implies we have never seen that index before, so just add it to the return list.
