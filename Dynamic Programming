1. Burst Balloons: O(n^3)
      
      instead of divide the problem by the first balloon to burst, we divide the problem by the last balloon to burst.
      Why is that? Because only the first and last balloons we are sure of their adjacent balloons before hand!
      For the first we have nums[i-1]*nums[i]*nums[i+1] for the last we have nums[-1]*nums[i]*nums[n].
      OK. Think about n balloons if i is the last one to burst, what now?
      We can see that the balloons is again separated into 2 sections. But this time since the balloon i is the last balloon
      of all to burst, the left and right section now has well defined boundary and do not affect each other! Therefore we can
      do either recursive method with memoization or dp.
      Take care of the three loops for this question: start, len, end and i which is the balloon you want to burst:
                      start=0;start<n-len;start++
                      end = start+len
                      i = start+1;i<end;i++
