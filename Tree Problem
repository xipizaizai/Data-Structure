1. Binary Tree Inorder Traversal:
      Can solve using recursion and iterative,iterative way is to use stack, keep adding the left node and pop a node and it's right node into the stack.
      recursion:
      recursively start with processing node.left, add root.val into list, and processing node.right;
      
2. Convert Sorted Array to BST:
      BST has property of left child <root<right child. So find the medium element to be the root and recursion left and right child

3. Convert Sorted LinkeList to BST:
      Same idea with above question, but how to find the medium node in LinkedList? use fast and slow pointer to get medium by fast = fast.next.next; slow = slow.next;
      then the slow pointer is the medium node, and use this method recursively.

4. Serialize and Deserialize BST: 
      This question is typical, using queue data structure to store nodes and get nodes in level order traverse.
      for Serialize, then using level order traverse. remember if child is null, add null into the stringBuilder
      for deserialize,add nodes in the queue in level order, for each level ,use another queue to store the element and then make the first queue each time equal to this second queue

5. Binary Search Tree Iterator:
      pop nodes in ascending order: So we need a methon called pushAllNode(TreeNode root). push all the left child into the stack, everytime when check the next node, then pop it out and push all of its right child into the stack
